# flag leak
**Flag: picoCTF{}**
## My thought process and approach to the challenge:
First I tried using `%p`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b58ea8ad-0416-4a87-abcd-0e88538339db)
which gave me
```

Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %P
Here's a story - 
0xffacc6f0
```
Then I tried using `%x` like:       
but that just gave me:

```
At first, all this made no sense at all to me, but looking at it further, I decided to analyze `6f636970:7b465443:6b34334c:5f676e31:67346c46:6666305f:3474535f:`            
So I tried using an online converter:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/370ce0aa-d1bf-415a-8048-06a129c96307)
This gave me the flag but it was jumbled.     
`ocip{FTCk43L_gn1g4lFff0_4tS_` and it wasn't the full flag because it didn't have and ending `}`.          
So then I tried using `%x` more times but that also didn't work.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0db3b252-00b0-4efa-aeea-d5f86576e95d)
As this was giving me the flag till the same point.            

Then I tried using:
`%36$x:%37$x:%38$x:%39$x:%40$x:%41$x:%42$x:%43$x:%44$x:%45$x:%46$x:%47$x:%48$x:%49$x:%50$x` to get more of the end part of the flag:
This gave me:

```
putting this to the converter gave me:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc8f55d5-6a4d-4e54-a522-a0d82c7a08d1)
Which was `ocip{FTCk43L_gn1g4lFff0_4tS_9_kc2e99}` the full flag but still jumbled.
after a lot of trial and error I got till
`picoCTF{L34k1ng_Fl4g_0ff_St4ck_999224e}` but that also didn't work
