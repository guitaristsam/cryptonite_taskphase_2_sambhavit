# format string 0
**Flag: picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_dc0f36c4}**
## My thought process and approach to the challenge:
Initially, I saw the netcat connection given `nc mimas.picoctf.net 50714` to open the program. After connecting and opening the program,        
I was given 3 options, and the goal was to exploit a string vulnerability to get the flag.           
Analyzing the code, I realized the program uses printf unsafely when handling user input, in particular functions.      
Through trial and error with the menu options, I discovered that inputting specific format strings allowed me to bypass checks and eventually revealed the flag: 
**picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_dc0f36c4}**

## Every single new concept and point of knowledge I learned or improved upon through solving the challenge.          
1. At first, I didn't understand why I got the flag so easily by just inputting menu options through trial and error, but then I understood how specific input, such as `Gr%114d_Cheese`, can manipulate the character count and bypass conditions.                     
2. Learnt how to use undefined behavior (e.g., %s accessing arbitrary memory) to reveal sensitive information like the flag in this case.

##  Incorrect tangents I went on while solving :
1. Initially overcomplicated the question and spent unnecessary time trying to exploit memory access through `%p` and `%x` specifiers instead of focusing on the simpler `%s` vulnerability in `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak`.
