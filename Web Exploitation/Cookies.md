## My thought process and approach to the challenge:
To be honest the name of the challenge was pretty much easy enough for me to get to the the inspect element and go to the cookies section,   
***Then saw a cookie of called `name` which had an initial value of `-1`***

***Then changed the value to `0` and reloaded the page and that gave me this :***

***Then changed the value to `1` and reloaded the page and that gave me this :***

***Went on doing this again and again incresing the numbers until I got the flag at name = 18 :***
