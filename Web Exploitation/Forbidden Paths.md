# Forbidden Paths
**Flag: picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}**
## My thought process and approach to the challenge:
The website presented a list of three text files and it provided a mechanism for the user to specify a file to be read. However, knowing that the flag was located in `/flag.txt`  understanding the restriction imposed by the website against absolute file paths, I understood that there was a need to find a way in order to evade the filter.

Using the directory traversal vulnerability, I  made a path of the form `../../../../flag.txt` which allows the computer to first go four branch folders backward to the root folder, then to open the `flag.txt` file. This approach worked effectively, allowing me to get past the restrictions and get the required flag.\

Then;

Using this I got the flag:**picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}**
## Every single new concept and point of knowledge I learned or improved upon through solving the challenge.
1. Practiced using directory traversal attacks to evade filters.  
2. Learnt and understood the importance of knowing about directory structure in web exploitation.  
3. Emphasized the necessity of `../` for directory navigation during a CTF Challenge.
##  Incorrect tangents I went on while solving :
- Initially tried entering `/flag.txt` directly, which failed due to the absolute path filter.  
- Attempted variations like `..flag.txt` and `/../flag.txt`, but these also did not work.
