# rail-fence
**Flag: picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7}**
## My thought process and approach to the challenge:
A file called `message.txt` was attached, which contained:
```
Ta _7N6D8Dhlg:W3D_H3C31N__387ef sHR053F38N43DFD i33___N6
```
Because of the name of the challenge, I knew it was a rail fence cypher, and the amount of rails were given : `4`.                    
So I used an online rail fence cipher decoder : https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/rail-fence-cipher.

The decoded text ws:
```
The flag is: WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7
```
This helped me get the flag : picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7}.
