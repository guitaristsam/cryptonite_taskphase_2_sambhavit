# substitution1
**Flag: picoCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_6E0659FB}**
## My thought process and approach to the challenge:
A file called `message.txt` was attached, which contained:
```
LKOb (bwvek ove lgqkhej kwj osgx) gej g kyqj vo lvrqhkje bjlhetky lvrqjktktvu. Lvukjbkgukb gej qejbjukjz dtkw g bjk vo lwgssjuxjb dwtlw kjbk kwjte lejgktftky, kjlwutlgs (guz xvvxstux) bitssb, guz qevmsjr-bvsftux gmtstky.

```        
Having no idea what to make of this, except the fact that the encoded flag was: `qtlvLKO{OE3AH3ULY_4774LI5_4E3_L001_6J0659OM}`   
I used https://quipqiup.com/ to help me determine and try to bruteforce the answer.

This solved the cipher and gave me the decoded text:
```
CTFs (short for capture the flag) are a type of computer security competition. Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service. CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment, and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice. For this problem, the flag is: picoCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_6E0659FB}
```
which in turn gave me the flag: picoCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_6E0659FB}.

## Every single new concept and point of knowledge I learned or improved upon through solving the challenge.
1. Improved upon identifying ciphers
2. Using online decoders effectively

---

##  Incorrect tangents I went on while solving :
1) Went on no incorrect tangents (pretty straightforward and easy challenge).
