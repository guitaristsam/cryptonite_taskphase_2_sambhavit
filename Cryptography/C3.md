## My thought process and approach to the challenge:
At first glace there were 2 files, 1 was some sort of encrypting python code and the other one was cypher text.
Tried to reverse and understand how the program worked and also tried to utilise the cypher text that was given,until I finally came up with this:
```python
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"
encoded_chars = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"
decoded_out = ""

prev = 0
for char in encoded_chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    original_index = (cur + prev) % 40
    decoded_out += lookup1[original_index] 
    prev = original_index 
print("Decoded message:",decoded_out)
```
***Got this output:***
```python
which gave me
Decoded message: #asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1

```         
At first thought something was wrong with my program because it was giving another program as an output?!!,      
At first tried running the code with the original cyphertext but it just gave something random like `L g H D P t`,    
Then realised after a lot of time, trial and errors and breaks that I had to do some thing else so used the output of the first program as a selfinput,

This helped me get the flag.
## Every single new concept and point of knowledge I learned or improved upon through solving the challenge.
1)Had to learn basic Python from strach because I had no idea how to iterpret and understand code in it (although most of it is like basic english).       
2)Had to learn to code and reverse enginner a program in python.         
3)Learnt how to not overcomplicate a coding problem and instead search for simple solutions.



##  Incorrect tangents I went on while solving :
1)I misunderstood the output `L g H D P t` as correct and tried various decoding methods (like Caesar cipher, base64 decoding) that were nothing but a waste of time.
2)Wasted my time running the code with variations of the original ciphertext(Let me tell you all that I tried: 1) Tried making the ciphertext in ascii order(because of the comments) and then try again.2) Tried the lookup even though it wasn't even remotely related.
